// Ex. 4.2.6 (**) - Decimal/Binary conversion
a) Write a program that asks the user for a number and then prints the binary representation of the number.
(If you donâ€™t know what a binary representation is, look it up. Computers use binary to represent
numbers.)
Note: e.g. 25 in binary is 11001
b) Write another program that does the inverse operation - converting binary to decimal.

let inputString = parseInt(prompt("Write a number: "));

let binaryNumber = inputString.toString(2);

console.log(binaryNumber);


let inputBinaryString = Number(prompt("Write a binary representation of the number: "));

let regularNumber = parseInt(inputBinaryString, 2);

console.log(regularNumber);
